        <!--<h2>My Philosophy</h2> -->
        <div class="about-text">
            <p>I began my career in Brazil, where I worked at a state university and hospital clinic, specializing in psychological support for high-risk pregnancies and neonatal loss. It has been a privilege to walk alongside women and couples during some of their most transformative and vulnerable moments.</p>
            <p>I hold a Certification in Perinatal Mental Health from Postpartum Support International and have completed specialized training in Children and Teenagers Psychotherapy at Instituto Nacional da Mulher, da Criança e do Adolescente Fernandes Figueira, in Rio de Janeiro. My approach integrates psychodynamic theory with attachment work and trauma-informed care.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I have received specialized training in conducting forensic evaluations for immigration cases, including hardship waivers, asylum, VAWA, T, and U visas. My training includes advance course work and supervision in forensic assessment, trauma-informed care, and the ethical considerations unique to psycho-legal evaluations.</p>
