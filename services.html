            <h2>My Services</h2>
            <p>I provide psychoanalytically-informed mental health support for individuals and groups,
            helping clients explore the deeper layers of their inner lives, understand unconscious
            patterns, and cultivate a sense of meaning and purpose. I also integrate other
            evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavior Therapy and Interpersonal Therapy
            to assist clients in meeting their goals.</p>

            <p>Above all, I believe in the healing power of the therapeutic relationship and am here to
            listen deeply, helping you rediscover your voice, strength, and direction.</p>

        <h2>Individual Therapy</h2>
        <p>In individual therapy, I work collaboratively with clients to explore the unconscious
        processes shaping their thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Together, we examine
        internal conflicts, relational patterns, and life narratives in a safe, containing
        environment.</p>

        <p>I support clients experiencing anxiety, depression, grief, relational difficulties, and
        life transitions, guiding them toward self-awareness, emotional integration, and
        resilience. Through this reflective work, clients gain insight into their inner world,
        uncover sources of suffering, and find renewed meaning and purpose.</p>

        <h2>Group Therapy for Pregnant and Postpartum Women</h2>
        <p>I lead groups for women navigating pregnancy and the postpartum period, focusing on
        the unconscious and relational dimensions of motherhood. These groups provide a
        reflective and supportive space to explore identity shifts, emotional ambivalence, and the
        complex psychological changes that accompany this transformative time.</p>
        <p>Participants examine unconscious anxieties, relational dynamics, and evolving maternal

        <p>Reports are tailored to meet legal standards while reflecting a nuanced understanding of
        each client’s emotional and relational life, s5upporting attorneys and clients in presenting a
