        <h2>The Power of Intention in Therapy</h2>
        <p>Healing begins with intention. In therapy, being intentional means approaching our inner work with awareness and purpose. When we clarify what we hope to understand, change, or cultivate, each session becomes a meaningful step toward that vision. Intentional goals provide direction while allowing space for discovery — they remind us that growth is not accidental but the result of mindful engagement with ourselves and our experiences. At Intentional Healing, therapy is a collaborative process grounded in reflection, curiosity, and a shared commitment to purposeful change.</p>
        <h2>Welcome! I’m Simone – a Licensed Mental Health Counselor in Florida</h2>
        <p>With over two decades of experience in both clinical and academic settings, I offer thoughtful, compassionate psychotherapy for individuals navigating life’s most meaningful—and often most challenging—transitions.</p>
        <p>My work is grounded in empathy, cultural sensitivity, and deep listening. I specialize in supporting women through complex life changes—from adolescence to motherhood and beyond—but I also warmly welcome men and nonbinary individuals. Whether you’re coping with grief, adjusting to parenthood, facing the emotional impact of immigration, or seeking clarity in a new phase of life, I’m here to support you with care, depth, and dedication.</p>
